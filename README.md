# Electronic Library Project

Welcome to the Electronic Library project! This project involves comprehensive data work in the realm of electronic libraries. I undertake the entire data lifecycle, from creating and populating the database to calculating product metrics, clustering users, and predicting churn.

## Features

- **Database Management:**
  - Creation and maintenance of a robust database.
  - Efficient handling of electronic library data.

- **Product Metrics:**
  - Calculation and analysis of key product metrics.
  - Insights into user engagement and product performance.

- **User Clustering:**
  - Utilization of clustering techniques to categorize users.
  - Understanding user behavior and preferences.

- **Churn Prediction:**
  - Implementation of predictive modeling to forecast user churn.
  - Proactive strategies to retain and engage users.

## Workflow

1. **Database Creation:**
   - Establishing a solid foundation with a well-structured database.

2. **Data Population:**
   - Populating the database with relevant electronic library data.

3. **Metric Calculation:**
   - Employing analytical techniques to compute essential product metrics.

4. **User Clustering:**
   - Utilizing clustering algorithms to group users based on behavior.

5. **Churn Prediction:**
   - Building predictive models to anticipate user churn and inform retention strategies.
  
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebooks
- PostgreSQL
